# CBHelper Ubuntu
Shell script to do CyberPatriot Ubuntu tasks.

Make sure to do chmod 755 for all the files that are included.

Will run updates, create an HTML page with every user and folder and the amount of memory they each use and a list of default Ubuntu programs, force update Firefox and Libre Office, set a password policy, and more.

TODO: Add a list of default Ubuntu 14.04 processes.

Written for Ubuntu 14.04! No guarantee it will work in earlier or later versions!!

DO THE FORENSICS QUESTIONS FIRST!!!

Notes:
	Make sure userlist.txt has the correct names (and that there is only one per line).
	Set who is admin/not after running the script, and fix admin passwords.
	
# CBHelper Windows
I replaced the PowerShell script with a Windows Forms program, becuase I HATE PowerShell. When its finished, it will have the ability to:

Set update policy, run updates, turn on the firewall, disable guest account, find media (probably), update Firefox, install Malwarebytes and Malwarebytes Anti Rootkit, set password policy, and set passwords (maybe).
