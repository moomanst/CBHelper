Pretty simple shell script to do much of the basic CyberPatriot Ubuntu tasks.

Will run updates, create an HTML page with every user and folder and the amount of memory they each use and a list of default Ubuntu programs, force update Firefox and Libre Office, and set a password policy.

TODO: Add a list of default Ubuntu 14.04 processes, configure the firewall, and run the virus scanner on the scripts exit.

Written for Ubuntu 14.04! No guarantee it will work in earlier or later versions!!

DO THE FORENSICS QUESTIONS FIRST!!!
